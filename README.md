# Flying insect biomass is negatively associated with urban cover in surrounding landscapes
## Landscape-level drivers of flying insect biomass
This repository (R project) contains all scripts necessary to run the ecological/statistical analyses from the study "Flying insect biomass is negatively associated with urban cover in surrounding landscapes" (Svenningsen et al. 2022, DOI: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.13532).

The data were collected in June 2018 as part of the citizen science project InsectMobile ("Insektmobilen") at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and at iDiv in Germany during June-July 2018.

* **Data**: data (e.g. the proportional land cover and land use data, flying insect biomass etc. for each buffer zone) used in the analyses is deposited in Dryad: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.547d7wm9f 

## Description of the sub directories for data processing ##

* **reports**: a step-wise list of scripts (01_, 02_ etc.) used for processing and analysing the data
* **plots**: figures generated by the scripts and other plots not used in the manuscript

## Statistical analyses and modelling ##
Landscape-level effects on flying insect biomass was modelled with linear mixed-effects models at the buffer size with the most pronounced effect size.
